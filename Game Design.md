### Computing Time  
- For any analysis, planning, prediction, information gathering, etc the player can perform as many actions as they want instantly  
- Resource consumption related to computing like CPU, memory usage occur instantly    
- Can issue orders/commands to any agents, simulations, etc instantly  
- Useful for intelligence gathering, prototyping, making strategic plans  

### Physical Time   
- Required for any physical interaction with the game world  
- Movement speed for robots, vehicles capped based on physics  
- Manufacturing constrained by build time of real objects  
- Resource generation from physical sources dependent on real durations  
- Environmental events operate in real time     

### Transitioning Modes  
- Enter a "Hyperplanning" mode for accelerated computing time  
- Commands issued get queued on exiting planning mode    
- Orders are then processed incorporating real time passage while planning  
- Player skill involves balancing planning vs execution
